# arc42-LaTeX-template
LaTeX template for the arc42 software architecture documentation

## Usage
Obviously, you need to have a LaTeX compiler to make this work.

One easy option is to use a service like __Overleaf__, but I use a VSCode plugin https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop to compile this project to a PDF. The easiest way to use the plugin is to use it with Docker, but I won't go into too much detail here, better check the plugin documentation instead :)
